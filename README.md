# GiraffeDet
## This is an Unofficial implementation for "GiraffeDet: A Heavy-Neck Paradigm for Object Detection" with Tensorflow 1.1x

### Notes: 
  * This code is based on my impletment of [yolof](https://github.com/JiXuKong/YOLOF) 
  * I am still running this code in colab and I am not sure whether there needs any conv op(like 3x3) in gfpn, If you add these ops it may costs lots of Display memory. With these     ops you can rnu 8 batch with a Tesla K80(free mem about 15G) with resolution of 384x384. Besides it's hard to converge without pretrain backbone, maybe you can switch to    * resnet.  
  * Any question are welcomed.Contact me with 1432452210@qq.com 


### Run in Colab
  * Tomorrow add the script
